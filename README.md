# E-Commerce Data Analysis Project

## üìä Overview
This project aims to derive insights from a comprehensive e-commerce dataset using SQL. The analysis includes identifying trends in sales, customer behaviors, product performance, and seller activity. The queries were designed to answer key business questions that could support data-driven decision-making for growth and customer satisfaction.

---

## üß† Objectives
- Detect duplicate customer entries.
- Identify top-performing product categories and states generating the highest revenue.
- Analyze total sales and revenue distribution by city and category.
- Discover product performance through customer reviews and identify the best-rated items.
- Highlight seller efficiency and contributions.
- Uncover ordering trends based on time (monthly) and customer activity.

## üßπ Data Cleaning
Before diving into the analysis, I performed several data cleaning steps to ensure consistency and improve readability:
- Timestamp Conversion: Several columns contained hashtag-style timestamp formats (e.g., ######). I converted these into standard YYYY-MM-DD datetime formats, enabling easier filtering and time-based aggregation.
- Column Name Refinement: Some column names were either unclear or poorly formatted. I renamed them to follow consistent, descriptive naming conventions. For example, columns like product_category_name_english were renamed to product_category_eng for clarity.
- Column Dropping: I removed columns that were irrelevant to the scope of this analysis or had too many null values, such as the ones in the location table: latitude and longitude.

## üß™ SQL Queries and Insights

### 1. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Checking for Duplicate Customers
This query identifies potential duplicate customers by checking how many times a `customer_id` appears.
```sql
-- Checking for duplicates
WITH duplicates AS (
	SELECT customer_id,
	city,
	states,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id) AS frequency
	FROM customers
)
SELECT c.customer_id,
	c.city,
	c.states
FROM customers c
JOIN duplicates d ON c.customer_id = d.customer_id
WHERE d.frequency > 1;
```
**üìå Interpretation:** Duplicates may hint at system issues or multiple accounts per user. This can impact personalized marketing strategies.

### 2. üåÜ Total Sales by City
```sql
-- Total sales by city
SELECT
	c.city,
	SUM(i.price) AS total_sales
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items i ON o.order_id = i.order_id
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN products p ON i.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY c.city
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

---

### 3. üõí Total Sales by Product Category
```sql
SELECT
	cat.product_category_eng AS category,
	SUM(i.price) AS sum_per_category
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items i ON o.order_id = i.order_id
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN products p ON i.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN product_category cat ON p.product_category_name = cat.product_category_name
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY sum_per_category DESC;
```

---

### 4. üîù Category with the Highest and Lowest Sales
```sql
-- Category with the highest and lowest sales
WITH revenue_by_category AS (
    SELECT
        cat.product_category_eng AS category,

    FROM orders o
    JOIN order_items i ON o.order_id = i.order_id
    JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
    JOIN products p ON i.product_id = p.product_id
    JOIN product_category cat ON p.product_category_name = cat.product_category_name
    GROUP BY cat.product_category_eng
