## üìä Overview
This project aims to derive insights from a comprehensive e-commerce dataset using SQL. The analysis includes identifying trends in sales, customer behaviors, product performance, and seller activity. The queries were designed to answer key business questions that could support data-driven decision-making for growth and customer satisfaction.

---

## üß† Objectives
- Detect duplicate customer entries.
- Identify top-performing product categories and states generating the highest revenue.
- Analyze total sales and revenue distribution by city and category.
- Discover product performance through customer reviews and identify the best-rated items.
- Highlight seller efficiency and contributions.

üóÇÔ∏è Database Schema Overview
---
To understand the relationships between the various tables used in this project, I referred to the official schema diagram provided with the dataset. This schema outlines how entities such as customers, orders, order items, products, sellers, and reviews are interconnected through keys like order_id, product_id, seller_id, and customer_id.

üìå Schema Preview:

![Schema](https://github.com/etimexo/O-list_analysis_SQL/blob/main/Images/schema.png)

This visual aid was especially useful during JOIN operations and while determining appropriate groupings for aggregation and analysis. It also helped in identifying the cardinality between tables (e.g., one-to-many relationships between customers and orders).

---

## üßπ Data Cleaning
Before diving into the analysis, I performed several data cleaning steps to ensure consistency and improve readability:
- Timestamp Conversion: Several columns contained hashtag-style timestamp formats (e.g., ######). I converted these into standard YYYY-MM-DD datetime formats, enabling easier filtering and time-based aggregation.
- Column Name Refinement: Some column names were either unclear or poorly formatted. I renamed them to follow consistent, descriptive naming conventions. For example, columns like product_category_name_english were renamed to product_category_eng for clarity.
- Column Dropping: I removed columns that were irrelevant to the scope of this analysis or had too many null values, such as the ones in the location table: latitude and longitude.

## üß™ SQL Queries and Insights

### 1. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Checking for Duplicate Customers
This query identifies potential duplicate customers by checking how many times a `customer_id` appears.
```sql
-- Checking for duplicates
WITH duplicates AS (
	SELECT customer_id,
	city,
	states,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id) AS frequency
	FROM customers
)
SELECT c.customer_id,
	c.city,
	c.states
FROM customers c
JOIN duplicates d ON c.customer_id = d.customer_id
WHERE d.frequency > 1;
```
![Schema](https://github.com/etimexo/O-list_analysis_SQL/blob/main/Images/duplicates_r.png)

**üìå Interpretation:** Duplicates may hint at system issues or multiple accounts per user. This can impact personalized marketing strategies. The result above shows that there weren't any duplicate customers.

---

### 2. üåÜ Total Sales by City
```sql
-- Total sales by city
SELECT
    c.city,
    SUM(i.price) AS total_sales
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items i ON o.order_id = i.order_id
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN products p ON i.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY c.city
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

![Schema](https://github.com/etimexo/O-list_analysis_SQL/blob/main/Images/cities_r.png)

**üìå Interpretation:** This insight helps identify cities with high and low sales performance, enabling the business to tailor marketing strategies accordingly‚Äîsuch as running targeted awareness campaigns, offering special discounts, or implementing other localized promotional efforts.

---

### 3. üõí Total Sales by Product Category
```sql
SELECT
	cat.product_category_eng AS category,
	SUM(i.price) AS sum_per_category
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items i ON o.order_id = i.order_id
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN products p ON i.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN product_category cat ON p.product_category_name = cat.product_category_name
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY sum_per_category DESC;
```

![Schema](https://github.com/etimexo/O-list_analysis_SQL/blob/main/Images/sales_by_cat_r.png)

**üìå Interpretation:** This highlights, in descending order, the product categories that generate the highest revenue. It provides valuable insight into which categories are driving sales the most, helping to inform inventory, marketing, and business strategy decisions.

---

### 4. üîù Category with the Highest and Lowest Sales
```sql
-- Category with the highest and lowest sales
WITH revenue_by_category AS (
    SELECT
        cat.product_category_eng AS category,
        SUM(i.price) AS total_revenue_per_category
    FROM orders o
    JOIN order_items i ON o.order_id = i.order_id
    JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
    JOIN products p ON i.product_id = p.product_id
    JOIN product_category cat ON p.product_category_name = cat.product_category_name
    GROUP BY cat.product_category_eng
),
min_category AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM revenue_by_category
    ORDER BY total_revenue_per_category ASC
    LIMIT 1
),
max_category AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM revenue_by_category
    ORDER BY total_revenue_per_category DESC
    LIMIT 1
)
SELECT * FROM min_category
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM max_category;
```

![Schema](https://github.com/etimexo/O-list_analysis_SQL/blob/main/Images/min_max_cat_r.png)

**üìå Interpretation:** This analysis identifies both the top-performing and underperforming product categories in terms of total revenue. Understanding these extremes helps businesses recognize which categories are thriving and which may require strategic improvements‚Äîsuch as promotional efforts, product reviews, or even reconsideration of inventory. It could mean boosting promotions for low-performing ones or doubling down on what‚Äôs already doing well. Either way, it‚Äôs a great way to stay on top of what‚Äôs working and what‚Äôs not.

### 5. üìÜ Total Orders by Month
```sql
-- Total Orders by month
SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM purchase_time) AS year,
    TO_CHAR(purchase_time, 'Month') AS month_name,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY 1, 2, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM purchase_time)
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
```

![Schema](https://github.com/etimexo/O-list_analysis_SQL/blob/main/Images/month_r.png)

**üìå Interpretation:** This breaks down the total number of orders placed each month across different years. It‚Äôs useful for spotting trends‚Äîlike which months are busier and when things slow down. With this, businesses can plan ahead for high-demand periods and prep marketing or inventory strategies accordingly.

---

### 6. üåü Average Review Per Category
```sql
-- Average review per category
SELECT cat.product_category_eng,
	ROUND(AVG(r.review_score), 2) AS avg_review_score
FROM product_category cat

---

### 8. üë®‚Äçüíº Top Sellers
```sql
-- Top sellers
SELECT s.seller_id,
	COUNT(i.product_id) AS no_of_products
FROM sellers s
JOIN order_items i ON s.seller_id = i.seller_id
JOIN products p ON i.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

![Schema](https://github.com/etimexo/O-list_analysis_SQL/blob/main/Images/sellers_prod_r.png)


**üìå Interpretation:** This shows the sellers with the highest number of products sold across the platform. It's a great way to recognize the most active and high-performing sellers. These top sellers might be ideal partners for exclusive deals, promotions, or even to understand what they‚Äôre doing right in terms of product quality, pricing, or delivery.
